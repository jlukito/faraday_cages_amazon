1,Absolute trash.,"This product is capitalizing on the irrational fears of individuals who think that their WiFi router, among other things, can actually harm them. Standing outside in direct sunlight is far more dangerous (by comparison) than being inside a home with a router. This WILL destroy the performance of your device and basically render it useless as a WiFi router. If wireless signals concern you that badly, just replace your WiFi router with a regular router/modem and hard-wire all of your devices.",1,0,43,2020-08-24,B0814BYHV6,1
2,Red to Green,Well worth the price. I bought a meter to confirm the amount of RF/EMF before and after and it went from red and yellows to all green. My 2bdrm condo is about 1400 sq ft and my router was shooting harmful stuff through the wall in my cable modem area into my bedroom. My sleeping is better now but I'm still monitoring for other positive changes. My signal and speed seems about the same for my video streaming services....i dont do a lot of online gaming.,5,1,16,2020-05-19,B0814BYHV6,2
3,A worthy investment for sure!,"I got metal pencil holders for our phones which is way more cost effective, so I do think this is pricey relative to that but it<U+0092>s a worthy investment. I do wish that the hole for the wires to route through were protected or smooth, it<U+0092>s a little sharp to stick your fingers into it.",5,1,7,2020-02-05,B0814BYHV6,3
4,Can't tell a difference,I bought after reading CIRS/mold toxcity can make you sensitive to EMFs. Read reviews and stated it does reduce EMFs. I honestly can't tell a diff other than our signal is weaker. I don't have a way to test it so I can't confirm if it does or doesn't work. I just haven't noticed any diff. Still turning router off at night.,3,1,4,2020-06-26,B0814BYHV6,4
5,"Liked the idea, unable to keep it","The idea was great, and we wanted to use it to help block the EMF. However, the router died the day we put it in the box. Internet provider said it was just at end of life, then gave us a new one that was a completely different size, so we were unable to keep this one.",4,1,3,2020-02-06,B0814BYHV6,5
6,Anything that blocks radiation works for me!,I feel better knowing that harmful radiation is blocked from my family & pets,5,1,3,2020-02-03,B0814BYHV6,6
7,Not safe to Handle,I immediately got two puncture wounds from fine wires sticking out of the edges of the top when I tried to remove for the installation of the modem. I can<U+0092>t speak to how good the product is and how would I know as I cannot measure the radiation any better than you. The wire work is terrible. Don<U+0092>t handle without gloves.,2,1,2,2020-01-27,B0814BYHV6,7
8,Not sure,Reduced emf. Not the easiest to get cables into,3,1,0,2020-02-06,B0814BYHV6,8
9,Hope it works,I don<U+0092>t have a way to test it and I hope it works. Looks good and durable but it does have some rough edges so be careful. Lid is removable and fits snugly.,4,1,0,2020-08-29,B0814BYHV6,9

16,WiFi blocker,The sides that are welded together are a bit sharp and not super appealing to the eye. Other than that I think it will get the job done!,4,1,0,2020-01-30,B0814BYHV6,16
17,Effective and high quality,Blocks the radiation without compromising the quality of our WiFi. The unit is assembled and ready to use out of the box.,5,1,0,2020-02-05,B0814BYHV6,17
18,Not for us.,This blocked our wifi to devices. Had to return.,2,1,0,2020-10-27,B0814BYHV6,18
19,Great protection but size is off,The Cage Guard is not large enough for the Xfinity Large WIFI Router I have. It's about an inch off Height wise.,2,1,0,2020-12-04,B0814BYHV6,19
20,EMF-Sensitive People: YOU NEED THIS!!,"I am EMF-sensitive to the point where I cannot breathe around devices or large appliances. My computer is a huge source of problems for me and I cannot use a cellphone at all. I have a Mac Mini desktop computer. I put my Mac Mini in this box and when I closed the lid, I felt immediate relief... the air changed from ""thick"" and ""smoky"" to thin and breathable... I'm using long cords to place the computer 50 feet away from my desk, but even while it's currently 3 feet from me I feel relief!",5,1,3,2020-12-02,B0814BYHV6,20

22,Wire Basket,This is a wire basket. This basket is designed to have people spend money on a wire basket. It does a great job.,5,0,4,2020-12-04,B0814BYHV6,22
23,I can<U+0092>t fit in the box. Terrible design.,This blocks 95% of the WiFi signal so to get a signal I have to stand inside the metal box. The problem is that I am over 6 feet tall and I cannot fit inside the box. Please make a larger one that is at least 6 feet tall so I can use my WiFi.,1,0,4,2020-12-04,B0814BYHV6,23
24,People are dumb<U+0085>,"Absolutely DYING at all of these paranoid weirdos.

You're better off living in the middle of absolutely nowhere if you want to avoid radio frequencies. Cellular signals are everywhere. Radio frequency itself is everywhere! It's not hurting you, it's so low powered it could never hurt you or your pets. Science is real, maybe do some studying from time to time.

The product does exactly what it says and nothing more. It's metal. It blocks radio from your router, making your router work harder for nothing. Stop being an idiot.",5,0,2,2020-12-04,B0814BYHV6,24
25,Kills signal strength from the router<U+0085>,"Devices that were previously located about 30-40<U+0092> from the router that used to have full signal strength, don<U+0092>t even connect to it anymore... I had to remove the cage from the router and now the return window has closed so I<U+0092>m stuck with this useless $100+ metal cage now... Will try and sell it on Craigslist.",1,0,0,2020-10-18,B0814BYHV6,25
26,Signal impacted,Wifi signal is reduced significantly,1,0,0,2020-07-24,B0814BYHV6,26
27,Works with slight modification,I bought an RF meter to check if it blocked the signal but it barely did anything. Did a little research though and found out that grounding it should work. So I went to home depot got some regular 20 gauge wire attached one side to the screw on the shield and the other side to a piece of conduit that goes into the ground and the RF meter reading dropped to almost nothing.,4,1,371,2016-12-08,B00OVJCPS6,27
28,"Works, needs grounding wire and product label. Overpriced.","This does work. It is made well. However, It is way overpriced. Be sure to get a grounding wire or a wire with clip ends to ground this out to your metal meter box. It should come with one. It should also come with a receipt and proper documentation. It would also be nice to have a brand name or label on it so the power company knows what it is and they do not remove it. These are cheap to make and I do not agree with charging this much to help people be safe. We need to help one another. Half of the price would be much more fair. While I agree there is no price for safety, that does not mean one should over capitalize on that.",3,1,276,2016-07-26,B00OVJCPS6,28
29,"
blocked electric company signal to bill me $$$$",So the electric company came out due to a drastic reduction in my electric bill. The company just ripped it off the meter and took it with them. Apparently it was blocking their ability to give me a correct bill.,1,1,68,2019-08-14,B00OVJCPS6,29
30,It worked for us,"We've had this installed for a little over a year. My daughter was experiencing painful headaches and just an overall tension in her room completely unexplained. She researched the smart meter outside her room and came across this. We bought it immediately, installed it right away. All headaches gone, tension gone, baby sleeps better. EMF causes headaches, triggers migraines and instills tension in the air. All this is gone. The price is worth it.",5,1,80,2018-08-19,B00OVJCPS6,30
31,Works great! Instantly felt relief. Don't believe the trolls that have left negative reviews.,"After our neighborhood had ""smart"" (i.e. dumb) meters forcibly installed about 9 months ago, our entire household has suffered horrible insomnia, irritability, ringing in the ears, body aches, nausea, and the a bunch of other typical symptoms. These meters are truly an atrocious crime against humanity, but most the world realizes this is how corporations operate now. I was skeptical that this could do anything, but after suffering for so long, I was willing to try anything. The moment I slipped the guard over the meter, I could instantly feel a quiet that I have not felt since the meter was installed. While I do not own a meter to actually measure, other family members noticed how light and happy the environment felt all of a sudden. Only after did I tell them I had installed the guard. It was as if a quiet scream had been playing on repeat since the meter was installed, and once that shield went over, the hell finally ended. There was a tranquility in our environment that had not been there in so long. Immediately, my nausea went away, as did the irritability. After a few days, my sleep finally improved drastically. The ringing in the ears is gone. I can still feel these symptoms when walking in my neighborhood where everyone else has the meter in full force. While I can't prove it works, I KNOW it works. The negative reviews about this product seem to be a purposeful assault on the seller because this obviously works. I commend the seller for calling out those that leave bad reviews without facts or knowledge to back it up. Furthermore, I am so grateful that this product exists. I have my sanity back. It is only after feeling what ""normal"" feels like that you realize how twisted our utility and communication companies have become. They do not care about people, nor their health. This allows you to take back your rights without all of the intimidation and red tape the utility companies and their contractors will use on you if you want a ""non-standard analogue meter"". I feel you have to live in an area where houses are not too close together to feel these effects, as the range is so intense that houses piled close together are likely still flooded in the RF waves. But if you have some space between your house and your neighbors, I could not recommend this more highly. The product is top-notch quality. When you see the attention to detail and how it is fitted perfectly for the meter, the reviews on here that talk about doing it yourself with cheap mesh wire are beyond laughable. The concept of a Faraday Cage is one of precision, and that is precisely what you get. To have something like this fabricated on your own would cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars. Worth every penny. Thank you to the folks that invented this. Fast shipping. Easy installation, even with my box being the 8% of boxes that require the rubber spacer (included) to properly fit.",5,1,205,2017-10-24,B00OVJCPS6,31
32,Will reduce your emf to almost nothing.,Great product. Cut the EMF from my smart meter to almost nothing. If you have a smart meter it is pulsing ever 14 second putting high levels of EMF into your home. I bought 3 for me and my adult children. Very happy.,5,1,43,2018-09-14,B00OVJCPS6,32
33,"crazy thing to buy, very expensive","I felt a little nutty buying this thing, but it's like a Faraday cage for the semi-smart meter the electric co insisted on putting on my house right near my bedroom. I could not get them to replace it with an analog meter. They said it's not fully smart, but I think they are lying. So I spent $ to buy this cage, and I stuck it onto the meter. I keep getting my bills, so the meter is working. This does not interfere with the co's ability to read the smart meter! I wish it did! So I don't know if it works, but it was something for me to do, so I did it just in case it helps keep the radiation down. Who knows?",4,1,32,2018-12-26,B00OVJCPS6,33
34,I sleep with a smart meter just a few feet from my head,"UPDATE: I changed rating to 5 stars. After reading comments I believe I'll try grounding it. I'm still happy with my purchase. The rest of my review is still untouched.

I almost gave this 5 stars... I sleep with a smart meter just a few feet from my head. I got an RF meter and measured spikes at 4.1 - 4.6 on my pillow. After installing this thing, I'm getting spikes at 0.6 - 0.8. So while I'm pleased to have drastically reduced the RF hitting my head at night, it was not the 98% reduction as claimed. If it had reduced it by 98% I would have been ecstatic to give 5 stars.",5,1,100,2017-01-31,B00OVJCPS6,34
35,Ive gotten 2 hours of extra sleep every night since ...,Ive gotten 2 hours of extra sleep every night since I installed. Plus the electric company cant get inside my head anymore. Amazing,5,1,52,2017-07-21,B00OVJCPS6,35
36,"Don't get a S,mart Meter without one!!!","So, what was driving me crazy for 5 years without me having a clue? How about my Smart Meter! It took me 5 years to figure out what was wrong with me! I Couldn't sleep, tinnitus, constant irritability, constipation, joint pain, headaches, you name it!!! I attributed everything to old age! Then I started researching Smart Meters and discovered the horrors the Electric Company won't tell you. In short I discovered the Smart Meter Guard. It took all of ten minutes to install! Using an RF Meter before and after there was a world of difference as in Night and day. That very night, I had one of the best night sleeps in years, about a month later, I started feeling my strength coming back, headaches were gone, tinnitus went away and my blood pressure even went down. Maybe a lot of my symptoms were psychosomatic, I'll never know, but All I can say is the RF Frequencies on my top floor and in my bedrooms are now non-existent!!! I'm thanking the people who created this great item. They may have added only God knows how many extra years to my life!!! Thanks again!!!",5,1,12,2019-09-13,B00OVJCPS6,36
37,Great products- works,"I'm an occ health nurse- recently became aware of the smart meter roll out program and negative health effects - my husband and I were both experiencing symptoms - headaches, heart palps, nausea, irritability, insomnia. this is a silent danger hurting millions with them not even knowing and needs to be exposed. Make your voices heard- call your state representatives and make them aware and your voices heard- at the very least, push for an Opt Out Program.",5,1,16,2019-03-28,B00OVJCPS6,37
38,Makes my thyroid happy,"I am not an electrician. I did oodles of research but instead choose this product. Yes, it is pricey. But also it is very easy to use.

I don<U+0092>t have a meter to submit objective evidence of how the levels dropped. However, once the smart meter was installed, my need for thyroid medication tripled. Once I put this over the meter, my need for thyroid medication dropped back to pre-smart meter amounts. While anecdotal, this is enough for me to recommend it to my family and friends.",5,1,12,2019-03-26,B00OVJCPS6,38

42,Cuts a small amount of signal outside your house but not inside of course,"OK, so you install it and test before and after. Yes, it cuts a tiny bit from outside, but go inside your house and test the wall where the meter is at, and guess what....yeah no effect. Isn't that the point of the whole thing? I'm not sure I recommend it.",1,1,6,2020-03-30,B00OVJCPS6,42
43,Did not work according to my EMF reader,Bought an EMF meter reader and it did not seem to make a difference as the surrounding bog lit it up like a Christmas tree<U+0085>,1,1,8,2019-10-03,B00OVJCPS6,43
44,Did not work for us,"Good idea but failed to work for us. We installed it just as the instructions suggested, with no grounding. Well, since the first night we installed it, we stopped sleeping through the night. Before it was just occasional insomnia, after - it was insomnia every night. We do believe the cover actually prevents the meter from being able to send a signal so instead the meter keeps trying to send the signal over and over which made the issue even worse for us. My husband is VERY sensitive to any signals and always we turn off our wifi router and all electronics every night. But with this meter guard, my husband started hearing and feeling even more buzzing in his head, so when he could deal with it no more, he got up in the middle of the night, put his housecoat on and went outside to take the darn guard off meter. Afterwards, we were able to sleep again and purchased an entirely different device that would not attempt to block the EMFs but rather neutralize them. So no, i would not recommend this.",3,1,0,2020-11-22,B00OVJCPS6,44
45,Good emf cover,"It came with directions for different types of meters with directions for each of them. I put cover on, and tightened best as it can.. it was larger than the meter I have and was lose, and I have to use the extra piece that comes with it to try to tighten it around it. Gives me peace of mind. I sleep better",5,1,5,2019-04-13,B00OVJCPS6,45
46,Very necessary !,This meter guard is necessary to absolutely reduce the RF (radio frequency) being put out by the Smart (Stupid) meter. My DWP forced me to have this installed so I chose this USA made guard to protect home and family/pets from any harmful radiation. Seller support is wonderful - giving instruction with videos for mounting and then using an RF meter to see the difference in levels. It works !,5,1,2,2019-12-14,B00OVJCPS6,46
47,Made for American Household - MOST American households,"It Fits, PERFECTLY! I don't know why you would order a different brand, I did a ton of research and this is the best product for the task. All the other ones are too small. I am not sure what energy company equips homes with smaller meters. This one fits great, and is made very well. Also the installation is a breeze. The only thing I had to MODIFY was cutting a small rectangle at the bottom to make space for the lock on the meter. After that it sits flush, no gaps.",5,1,0,2020-11-20,B00OVJCPS6,47
48,Yes it works......,This thing works. The EMF coming from the meter was blocking all my garage door remotes from working and even messing with my motion light sensors . Now everything is back to working as it should. Ya I think it<U+0092>s overpriced but I paid it.

76,I like the concept of this product,"I like the concept of this product; however, I think the price is ridiculous. People can make their own 'smart meter' guard with aluminum screening and duct tape for a fraction of the cost. Is it a good, useful product? Yes.

90,Smart Meter Guard,"Customer service is very good; however, the guard did not lower the radiation enough. My HF35C meter from Germany showed readings above 199.9 (I did not measure on the higher setting to see if it was even higher). After reviewing the manual, I saw that two European organizations said that 1 should be the highest (limiting) value, so I still do not feel comfortable sleeping in this area.

Provision is made in this band to accommodate a meter lock or seal. While the mesh cover does somewhat obstruct the view of the digital numbers on the meter, they are still visible..... similar to the Faraday cage in your microwave oven. The utility company reads the meter remotely by the signals emitted from it.

96,Glad I Bought It,"After reading a number of books on the harmful effects of electromagnetic fields, especially radio, microwave frequencies, all of which recommend this product, I decided to purchase one for my smart meter. The wire mesh guard acts as a Faraday cage, reflecting radio waves and sending them back to the electric company. It lets just enough radio waves through to give them a meter reading. I also purchased a Faraday cage from these people for my WiFi router. The guy who makes these is an electrician. His video testing the strength of the RF frequency with and without the guard is a must see. It made me decide to buy the product. Go to the Smart Meter Guard website to find it. The best book on the subject is ""Overpowered,"" by Dr. Martin Blank, PhD. ""Dirty Electricity,"" by Samuel Milham, MD is also good.",5,1,63,2015-04-26,B00OVJCPS6,96

114,Sounds good but there will be ramifications and you will pay to fix the problem.. Ready below..,"Just a heads up that the ""point of demarcation"" for the electric utility, phone company and cable company is a box on the side of your house which you agreed that they could put there to provide you the service they provide. An electric meter does emit radio waves however it is only listening 99.999999999% of the time each month for the meter reader to come by your house and send it a wake up signal so that it will respond with your current meter reading. When the electric company finds you have put a Faraday cage around ""THEIR METER"" which is mounted in ""THEIR METER BASE"", you will find it gets removed from your house, and you will get a nasty letter from them telling you not to mess with their property... And they will be right. You will then get a bill for all the power you used that you didn't get billed for plus any late payment charges and probably a bill for the meter department employee who had to come out and take the thing off ""THEIR"" meter. This is about a dumb as pouring concete into your water meter hole in the front yard. You are not under any more danger from RF radiation coming out of your electric meter than you are from the WIFI we all use at home to get on the Internet. PS... The power company will not be happy so if you have one of these you better take it off and you may avoid the nasty letter, the late fees and other issues you will face for putting it on ""THEIR METER"" to start with...",1,1,10,2019-12-11,B00OVJCPS6,114

122,This is how you know it works,"When I bought this I wanted to rent a EMF meter to measure before and after but there were two events that happened that convinced me it is working.

The first event was the main reason that I bought it. My wife's head is 5 feet from the meter when she sleeps and I worried that the meter RF could affect her health. She noticed that slept much better immediately after I first installed it, and still sleeps better almost a year later. She normally doesn't notice any correlations like that, but it made an obviously noticeable difference for her.

The second confirming event was that my power company has come to replace the smart meter TWICE in the year since I installed this shield. Both times, the contractor did not know why he was replacing it. None of my neighbors had theirs replaced, the neighborhood was built in 2005, with all smart meters. My bill still shows the correct power usage and they are not doing manual reading, so my signal is received by my neighbor who is passing it on to the utility in the mesh network. But they know my signal is weaker. I marked this last meter replacement date on the calendar so I can see how long until they replace it again.

This cover does not fit over my (pre-Eaton) Cutler Hammer combo meter distribution box very well. So I just taped it to the meter box using this aluminum foil tape: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002EX855S
Wrapping the whole meter with this tape would probably work as RF shield, imo.

I received excellent email support from the seller/mfg of this meter shield. He replied quickly by email several times before and after the sale. I sent him pictures of my meter and he advised how to install it.

Mine has been outside for a year. There are no rust stains so it is high quality stainless steel. The meter-changing tech was not very gentle in removing the shield so a small part of the screen got a little bent, but that did not affect reinstalling it. It is very tough.",5,0,5,2019-08-22,B00OVJCPS6,122
123,Snake Oil,"A cell phone next to one's head creates a thousand times more radiation than any Smart Power Monitoring Meter ever would, sitting as they do some distance away and transmitting intermittently, while even a cell phone creates less exposure than a single high-altitude jet flight across the country. The ""EMF Shield"" is an example of expensive snake oil being pushed by predatory companies who make money by scaring people.",1,0,7,2019-12-11,B00OVJCPS6,123
124,Easy to install and it works.,"Easy to install and it allows are meter to be read. I was not sure if our meter could be read as we live in the country. But so far so good. I had been looking for some way to damp down the meter signal and after reading the reviews and web sites, I ordered this and feel like this was the best solution for us.",5,1,14,2015-02-26,B00OVJCPS6,124
125,You are wasting your money - There is nothing to worry about,"I am a Radio Frequency Engineer, the RF output from a Smart Meter is less than a typical cell phone and operates under FCC Part 15 regulations, which governs very low power transmitting devices, the transmission from a Smart Meter is bursted, meaning it only transmits for a very short period of time, the duty cycle (% of time its transmitting) of a typical smart meter is less than 0.5%. The frequency of operation is typically in the 902 MHz and 2.4 GHz bands.
The intended range of a transmitter in a smart meter is typically very localized. While the utility-side radio needs to reach a neighborhood concentrator, typically mounted on a nearby pole, smart meters can also mesh through other smart meters to communicate with the concentrator. (using five hops or less)
The smart meter only communicates when it is commanded to do so, typically several times a day, so its not on constantly. You are going to get more RF energy from your microwave or cell phone that you ever will from a smart meter.",1,0,2,2020-08-18,B00OVJCPS6,125
126,Cell phone EMF is much worse than the SmartMeters - research information around that,"I started researching on EMF after my phone made it on the SAR list of phones and how is the radiation level measured in the industry. Research brought me to Smart Meters during this effort and when you check ""Comparison"" as a keyword between the Smart Meter vs Cell phone or cordless phone or microwaves radiation - you would be surprised...

While this product does what it is advertised to do - minimize EMF radiation per measured levels in the available video on YT, it is not as dangerous as your cell phone is... or cordless phone ... or standing in front of the working microwave...

I cannot agree with the price point at all... for a piece of material put together to eliminate a little bit of EMF is a steep price honestly. I plan to take the aluminum window net and simply put zip tie around it and see what happens - because again, if this was a cell phone case that eliminates EMF radiation, I would have paid $100+ price tag... this one - definitely not worth it in my opinion.",3,0,1,2019-02-15,B00OVJCPS6,126
127,If it works your electric company will remove it,"I had one of these on the smart meter on my triler and those electric company people kept saying I was trying to steal power.

I'm not that type of person but when they took it and said don't tamper with my meter I had to do something.

I got a big metal bucket, some fine chicken wire and some heavy gage copper wire and clamps to attach between the bucket and the power lines and a bag of fast drying cement. I've filled the bucket with the fresh cement then I'm going to wrap my head in the chicken wire to get good grounding and stick my head in the bucket to sleep.

130,Poor design and quality.,"I purchased this item for my home meter in Los Angeles CA. There are no size or other options in choosing a smart meter guard. This is a one size fits all, or at least that is the design intent. The quality of guard is that of a prototype. It most certainly did not look or feel like a finished product. But I was eager to have this device work. It was too small to fit over the meter. i took photographs of my meter and sent along an explanation of the problem. They were reluctant to accept that the guard would not fit the meter. I took more photos of the guard with the meter illustrating the fitting issue. They did not send a return label. I returned the item at my cost. I did receive my refund immediately. I would NOT recommend this product. Poor design and fabrication. And if it did fit it is clearly way overpriced.",1,0,25,2016-07-03,B00OVJCPS6,130
131,Crap product,"Listen up people. 5G is not the issue. Don't like 5G, then move off grid. All this is going to do is cause the electric company to come out and check on your meter, they will find that you illegally blocked their transmitter, remove it, and then you will be out of money.

Seriously people. Get a life. 5G waves are all around. Blocking ONE tiny transmitter that only transmits once a day or even once a week is not going to save you.

142,RF Engineer Opinion,"Smart meters are designed to radiate out the back of the meter for a few reasons. Many meters are located at the back of a home. In this case, radiating out the back of the meter focuses the meters energy towards the street where mobile utility meter readers have higher probability of receiving a stronger signal.

For the case where a meter is located on the side of a home, radiating back through the homes structure provides diffraction and scattering effects to the radio signal, increasing the odds of the meter reader receiving the signal.

Were the signal to strike, say the brick side of the neighboring house, lees scattering and diffraction of the signal happens. If the signal went out the back of the house, less signal would likely make it to the street, particularly for homes located adjacent to forests and vacant land.

A faraday cage is a fully enclosed surface. Wire mesh volumes that are not enclosed such as this meter shield are not faraday cages, and foremost will not shield occupants from RF radiation at all because the back of the meter still radiates into the structure.",1,0,22,2017-10-02,B00OVJCPS6,142

145,Doesn't do anything,"The two technologies used for Smart Meters are either mesh technology and cellular.

For mesh networks, it just needs to send a signal a short distance to a neighboring meter in the net - which does NOT require a strong signal. For cellular, it's literally using the same type of radio found in the average cell phone, and sends on average a couple text messages a day. Once again, only a couple times a day.

160,It actually works.,"I didn't know this kind of thing existed until I researched RF Wifi radiation hazards and realized we couldn't move our modem/router. So I bought a radiation reader just so I knew what I was dealing with, this EMF reader brand is great by the way. So here's a picture of my router/modem RF measure 2 feet away reading at 235 RF. I unplugged both and put both in the cage, it overlapped a little and all 5 wires were able to fit through the circle, I took out the plug, and it closed fine. I measured it again from the same distance and it read 2.9 RF. That's a huge difference, safety standard is <10. So proof that it works, I feel better sitting next to it on the couch and having my kid play around the area now! Also there has been no noticeable difference with wifi strength, Netflix, surfing, cell phone speed all exactly the same as before.",5,1,2,2020-10-05,B08CK65GY8,160

163,Does not work!!!!,I recently purchased this item to reduce my EMF exposure. I had a EMF specialist come to my home to take readings to help improve my quality of life and try to reduce my overall exposure within my home. I'm ultra sensitive to EMF's due to chronic Lyme and a compromised immune system. He validated that the router guard had no impact at all. Save your money and do not purchase this product. IT DOES NOT WORK.,1,1,171,2018-10-18,B01IJD22YG,163
164,MAJOR LEAGUE FAIL,"If you're going to pay over 60 bucks for this thing, it should be able to accomodate the wiring which goes with the unit that goes inside it. There is one relatively small hole for which to pass the wires through, needless to say, it don't do the job!. This is a BIG FAIL. Sorry but I am VERY fair with all my reviews and I ain't going to change that now.",1,1,94,2018-04-15,B01IJD22YG,164
165,Actually reduces RF radiation from a router,"After I learned about EMF dangers, I wanted to do something to reduce the intensity of the WiFi signal from my router. My computer is wired to the router with an Ethernet cable, but I use WiFi for my cell phone quite often. I was skeptical of this Router Guard, but it seemed to be my only option. After I put my router in it, I tested it with an EMF meter (Cornet ED-78S, using the RF function). When the cage was open, at a distance of about 6 inches, the reading fluctuated around 35-45 mW/m2 and when the cage was closed, the reading fluctuated around 0,5-1.5 mW/m2. At a more reasonable distance of about 2.5 feet (which is how far the router is from my work chair), when the cage was open the reading fluctuated around 5.5-8.5 mW/m2 and when closed the reading fluctuated around 0.2-0.9 mW/m2. These readings are probably specific to my router and should not be taken as absolutes, but the difference between an open cage (unguarded) and a closed cage are remarkable enough to convince me that I got my money's worth.
One problem, however, is that there are no holes in the box for wires. The directions say to just close the lid over the wires, but an Ethernet cable is not supposed to be bent sharply, Without bending my cables (inbound feed, Ethernet out, telephone out, and power line) the lid would not close. So I used a hacksaw to make two cuts about 3/4 inch apart and 3/8 inch deep on the top rim of the box (about where the indent on the lid falls) and folded down the material to make an opening for the cables to pass. Then, when the lid is pressed down, it has sufficient play in it to close without bending the cables more than slightly. I also wrapped the cables with aluminum foil to block the opening. Then I used some wire at each corner to keep the lid closed.
By the way, even when the router is sealed in the cage, my cell phone picks up the WiFi signal with no problem throughout the room.",5,1,152,2016-11-06,B01IJD22YG,165
166,Works better than the thick one I made ??,"I have attached video showing end sensor proves it works. Easy to set up and install, my wife did it. Easy way to remember which plug goes where, just put tape over the wires before unplugging",5,1,102,2018-02-01,B01IJD22YG,166
167,Excellent!,"My router fits in the box perfectly! There is a small hole for the cords to run through. Other reviews complained of a 'slit' that the wires wouldn't fit through, they must have fixed that because I have no trouble. Tested it with a EMF detector and it lowers the EMFs from 100+ to 2-3 without affecting the signal throughout the whole house (2400square ft - works in every room).",5,1,51,2018-08-17,B01IJD22YG,167
168,For your own sake.............,"First of all there is no opening cut for the wires so it can't be closed unless you get a hack saw and cut appropriate opening to accommodate the wires. There is a 1"" wide cut in the upper part of the short side with no corresponding lower cut so to close it you'd need flat wiring. This does not accommodate coaxial wire...just a single flat power cord. When I requested to return the unit due to this obvious engineering problem, I was told I had to pay the shipping back to them. When I insisted they pay the freight they finally sent me a paid return label BUT DEDUCTED IT FROM MY REFUND.",1,1,125,2016-12-09,B01IJD22YG,168

This costs less than 5$ fob to make and if they don<U+0092>t reduce their cost ASAP I<U+0092>m going to have this remade with my own supplier, put holes in the right places, redesign, and sell online for a fraction of the cost.",1,1,20,2019-12-17,B01IJD22YG,169
170,It works,"The Pro: It does what it says and reduces EMF by about 90% emitting from whatever electronic device you place in it. If you are sensitive to EMF, this made my living space more manageable and noticeably more conducive for mind clarity and relaxing. I also noticed a reduction in heat in the room of where the wifi is connected.

The Con: I did notice a decrease in internet performance. But to us its worth it. There has only been one time where we had to open up the top of the container to amplify the connection.

As an alternative if you didn't want to purchase this, you could always just unplug your internet and that works too. I like the convenience of this myself.",5,1,28,2018-10-19,B01IJD22YG,170

174,Barley reduced wifi signal,"I bought this based on a YouTube review which seemed to indicate good capabilities as regards bringing down the strength of wifi signal. Our router tested very high, and since using wifi regularly I have noticed negative health impacts. I get brain fog and dizzy spells while in high wifi environments. These symptoms dissipate once away from such signals. I really wanted this product to work but it barley moved the needle down in terms of attenuating our signal. At nearly 70 dollars I was not impressed. Also the lid did not have a snug fit and the mesh seems too big in terms of the hole sizes. The same day I decided to create a home made Faraday cage using an old ammo can. For 20 minutes of work, and no expense I made a router guard that works a lot better. I still hope to find a way to lower my signal further and will continue to experiment with materials and cage styles.",2,1,5,2019-06-10,B01IJD22YG,174

2. Radiation from a WiFi router does not cause harm. All devices emit radiation: light bulbs, TVs, computer screens, phones, tablets, microwaves, toasters, garbage disposals, trash compactors, security cameras, plants. You're better off putting _yourself_ in a Faraday cage rather than your router.

Second, if you're that worried about WiFi signals, which have never been linked to any health hazard, then don't use WiFi. Get a wired router. The amount of EMF emitted by a WiFi is so low that its functionally radio waves, meaning you're more likely to be ""injured"" by your car stereo. At a foot or so, your microwave belts out 25 mG, or milli-Gauss, compared to a typical routers 5-6, meaning 5 routers a equal to 1 microwave. What're you typically in front of a foot away, your WiFi source or your kitchen?

Third, The Faraday cage will function for the most part, which means you're buying a signal source design to work at 200-300 feet, and making it work at only 100-200 feet, meaning you'll have to buy more wireless repeaters to get the same signal strength from your Wi-Fi source, compounding your problem.

Furthermore, although it reduced the EMF from my 5G dual band router, it reduced the 2.4g to where it would not even work in the next room. If you. have a dual band router, you are better off just disabling the 5g, otherwise you can just buy a file holder for $10 for the same results.",2,0,16,2019-09-15,B01IJD22YG,213

I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and the Internet; and watched the videos showing how it blocks the radiation. The videos were very convincing and sealed the deal for me. My router is in my bedroom, so I feel safer knowing the radiation is being blocked.

A lot of people were concerned about the wifi signal being reduced or even blocked. In fact, there's a one page helpful explanation that comes in the package as well. So, before I did anything, I checked my wifi speeds.

I went to speedtest.net and tested without the guard. My download and upload speeds were 15 and 10. I put the guard on and speeds were 98 and 11. WHAT?! I was expecting to see less not more. Okay, I tried again. Same thing.

I started testing by alternating between the guard on and the guard off. 7 tests in a row with the guard on. 7 tests in a row with the guard off. The numbers were very consistent for both.

Guard off: DL - 15, UL - 11
Guard on: DL - 14, UL - 10

I just did another test with the guard on and I got 15 for DL and 11 for UL. So the wifi results with the guard on could be the same as the results with the guard off. It's a very small difference, if at all.

I think the creator should do a video testing the wifi speeds and showing the results. That should alleviate a lot of concern.

223,Helps a little,"I bought this directly from their official website. Got the larger model. I tested the EMF from about 3 - 4 feet from the router. With the box it went down from 6V/m to 2.5V/m, but closer to the router it still recorded 6. So it does help a little but not as much as reducing 95% of EMF as claimed.

Edit: Added one star because in other rooms the readings improved from 1.5 to 0.4 so that was very good considering the wifi was on. Just in close proximity it is still high. I also found out the apple tv emits at 6V/m so it could have affected my first readings. Turn off your apple tvs!",4,0,1,2019-01-28,B01IJD22YG,223

Our living room, kitchen and two bedrooms were still covered via Wifi, but our remote bedroom was not. Just what I wanted. This is a simple Faraday cage big enough for Comcast modem/router towers. Tip: Use the base as the top for the Comcast tower and everything fits fine. Don't accept 5G routers. They will give off a lot more energy since the emitting frequency is higher. Our router is 4G, so that was not a problem. 5G has an unproven record of safety so do not upgrade your phone until more studies are done.",5,1,56,2020-05-23,B07MXD75TR,233

The signal was full strength red in the danger level from 4 feet away. After placing the router in the cage and properly routing the wires and cables the signal was now in the green (as low as it could go) from 4 feet away. Only after placing the meter on top of the metal cage did I read signal strength in the yellow (safe zone). This product worked exactly as advertised, reducing the Rf by 95%. I Tested the wi fi with my cell phone upstairs as far from the router as I could get, still had full signal.

It fits perfect over our router. It looks neat and best of all I feel safer sitting next to it. Sure, it might all be in my head, but I haven't had any headaches since we got it. The wifi isn't as strong across the house and our adult child thinks we got this so he wouldn't be on his phone all night long. It's a win win and I'm very happy with my purchase.

239,This product is a perfect example of how to rip off people who fear misinformation about RF.,"If it is dark outside, do you turn on your lights and then lock them in a closet. Light is a form of radiation, but if you put a basket over the table lamp in your bedroom, your room will be dark but you won't be getting RADIATED by you nasty light bulb. My goodness, think about this.. It costs next to nothing to produce this product and it weights nothing. So you pay for the manufacturing and the shipping plus some profit with the $25.00 shipping charge and then find out that your WIFI doesn't work anymore around your house. Thats probably because you could have saved lots of time and money by just putting it in your neighbors garage or basement. How much light do you think you would get from a standard lightbulb if you reduced its output by 95%. Not enough to read by, but that is what your doing when you put your WIFI Router inside of this cage. What do you do when you go to Home Depot or McDonalds or anywhere else, where there is free WIFI like the MALL????. You can't get away from it no matter where you go so lets understand, its not dangerous and if you think it is, you have more problems than WIFI in your life. Anyone who pays good money to buy this product or any of the other items like the Electric Meter Shield need to go see a shrink about their paranoia...

240,Shielding is Minimal at Best,"I bought the Smart Large WiFi Router Guard for use in my home office. For several reasons beyond my control, the router must be near my desk/work station. My ASUS router is located on a metal filing cabinet approximately 36"" from my head, depending on the position of my chair.
As a safety measure, I have placed my router on the floor in between the filing cabinet and the wall. Using a CORNET RF meter, I have signal strength at my work position of about 0.0270 to 0.800+, with an occasional spike over 1.0. mW/m2 range. 1.0 is considered by many to be the max safe limit for continued exposure. Most of the readings are in the 0.300 - 0.500 range.
With the router on top of the filing cabinet, the mW/m2 range is around .690 to 3.00 with slightly higher spikes.
With the shield on, I get 0.600 to over 5.00.
The attached photo shows that the router shield is properly installed, yet a reading of 126.4 is shown. I realize the meter is very close, but I wanted readers to see that a high level of RF escapes the cage.
I doubt if its operator error.
I will continue to test and report if I get different readings in the future. I'm considering sending the unit back for a refund. I gave it two stars for the quality construction.",2,1,6,2020-09-18,B07MXD75TR,240

256,This device increases your exposure to electro-magnetic radiation!,"A cage that reduces the signal strength of transmitted power will also reduce the strength of received power. This means that the signal transmitted by your phone, laptop, smart watch, fire stick, or other Wi-Fi device needs to be more powerful to penetrate the shield.

Many people don't realize that the body absorbs thousands of times more radiation from the personal devices close to our bodies than from the routers, small cell sites, or towers that are much farther away. This is because wireless signals dissipate at the square of the distance they travel.

Many also don't realize that wireless devices adapt their signal power internally according to the distance the signals have to go and the interference they encounter. Wireless devices measure received power and tell the device on the other end to turn it up or down until it gets into the optimal zone for high speed transmission and minimum battery drain.

If you shield your router, it will tell your personal device to increase its transmitted power level. That causes your body to absorb more radiation. This device doesn't protect you from your phone.

I suspect that the people who fear EMF energy aren't looking to increase their exposure, but that's what will happen if you use this thing. It's a scam, and a hilarious one at that. Maybe I should go 2 stars for the lulz.",1,0,3,2020-11-30,B07MXD75TR,256

271,"Does not fit for smart meters for LADWP in Los Angeles, CA.",This is very well constructed and a great product. Unfortunately it does not fit my meter; it is not large enough.

272,Not very effective according to our trifield meter - better to build one yourself,"Gave this a chance since we were looking for a smartmeter Faraday cage for my daughter's science fair project. Even when we covered the hole/gap with EMF blocking tape and also taped it to our smartmeter this leaked alot according to our meter. Her comparison cages that she made herself out of things like aluminum screening worked BETTER at blocking harmful radiation versus this expensive made in China type knock off. And that is despite the aluminum one having been a fairly crude model. In this case you do NOT get what you paid for. I would try returning this but do to not having tried/tested it until her Science fair it is probably way past time. I could post pics later of our readings using different materials. There is a different one of these for sale NOT called a 'cover' I think it's called a shield, that does NOT have a hole... Unfortunately I think you have to pay almost double than this... I CANNOT recommend this as it let a LOT of pulses through... Remember the pulses may take a long time to send again... Sometimes they come fast sometimes they may take 30plus minutes and you might *think* oh wow this is working but if you wait long enough (we set the meter on a table set up near the smartmeter so we would not have to continuously expose ourselves to EMF etc) you will see this doesn't make much difference at all. Highly dissatisfied.

Finally, if you are getting one of these to protect your family don't forget that covers/shields do nothing to mitigate the dirty electricity these meters produce... For that they sell filters that plug in the wall or somehow connect to the circuit breaker/electrical wiring of your home. Both are pretty expensive but worth it for health.

Also dont forget WiFi is bad too so if you are not able to completelygo wifi free by using Ethernet cords due to the expense or inconvenience (I am in a two story house and haven't gotten around to rewiring the house yet) at minimum unplug your router at night so atleast your body can attempt to heal and repair during sleep.

Cell phone should be used only (or as much as possible) on speaker only... Preferably carried only on airplane mode ... I know this is NOT convenient and I can't always do it because of having kids in school, I need to be reached so can't use airplane mode when they are not with me ...but whenever possible do NOT have your cellphone on your body or too close... It is CONSTANTLY sending radiation out as it gets to search for the nearest cell tower...

Look into 5G and how bad it is... I suggest stop5G group on FB for more info on that.

Bluetooth is also bad fyi... Avoid whenever possible.

Be safe!!

There are about 10,000 plus studies on the dangers of EMF... Worldwide... The info is out there... US has needed for years to review and lower what they call their safety limits... It is way above the danger/damaging effects to humans level... Unfortunately lots of $$$ would be lost if we made these corporations like telecommunications have to be more honest about the effects of EMF etc on our health...

Finally, don't ever put iPads or laptops in your lap... All this type of radiation can damage your fertility and is cancer causing etc...

277,What the power company doesn<U+0092>t tell you.,Perfect solution from getting fried by the power company. Looking for blanket to cover panel.,5,1,11,2018-06-30,B075KMT5HW,277
278,UPDATE: IMPORTANT!,"My first review starts where the asterisk is, below.
I was going through something idk what.
I felt kind of depressed, no motivation, no energy, my home was a mess.
I'm okay most of the time, I do have depression but it made no sense and I was just so TIRED.
I put the meter cover on (see below).
That's been 4 or 5 days ago now something like that.
I JUST NOW realised I felt completely better all of a sudden a day or two after the cover went on.
I can't describe it...I was deteriorating to the point of lethargy.
Now I'm myself again.
I really think the virus is actually last minute work on 5g.
I mean, I haven't seen any sick people but I HAVE seen privately owned utility trucks, empty cartons of LED bulbs outside of schools, and odd computer glitches (this morning while making a deposit the drive thru atm cancelled my transaction right in the middle of it, stuff like that).
Get one.
I don't know why I felt so done.
I dont know why I feel like myself again so suddenly.
But deductive reasoning says the one thing that happened that may have helped was putting the cover on my meter.
Whoa.

*It is just fine except in my neighborhood it's doomed.
As soon as some fool notices it I guess it'll just get pulled right off.
It's snug but meter glass has slight slope inward.
I used a locking nut and filed the screw all to hell but that won't matter.
Well, will enjoy while I have it.",5,1,5,2020-03-21,B075KMT5HW,278
279,"Everyone should have one of these, but they are probably over-priced too","I'm not sure why these are so expensive, but this was the best one I could find. It didn't seem to do as good of a job at reducing radiation as the $6 metal garbage cans have been using to shield my electronic devices, but this may not be the fault of the product. I have heard from other sources that utility companies started designing their smart meters to increase signal strength if they sense that the signal is getting blocked by something. If this is true, it basically defeats the purpose of putting one of these on. I think it might still be reducing the signal a little bit though, maybe to 1/2 vs the reduction to 1/20 I'm getting from those metal waste baskets.

My main issue is that I think everyone is over-charging for these. I bet I could charge $200 for those $6 waste baskets if I could keep people from figuring out that they are just waste baskets! This is just a little bit of thin metal mesh shaped like a meter, so it's basically worthless as far as the materials are concerned.

So I gave the high number of stars because I think this is a great product that lots of people need, but I took off one star for it being really over-priced for what you are actually getting.",4,1,3,2019-08-12,B075KMT5HW,279
280,"Placebo or not, im interested","I have a smart meter right above my room, I was always trying to figure out why I wake up about 4 times per night. After installing this guard I only wake up once and dont have bags under my eyes.",5,1,13,2018-12-31,B075KMT5HW,280
281,Seems like a great product!,"I ordered one of these to cover my smart meter. I do not have any way of actually testing if it reduces signals created by my meter. I can say that this is well built, and I do not see any reason as to why it would not work. I did have to install both foam insulation strips to get this to securely fit my meter. My meter was provided by Xcel Energy.",5,1,6,2018-12-11,B075KMT5HW,281
282,Does not reduce anything,Purchased this along with an emf tester. It is not blocking anything. Very disappointing.,1,1,6,2020-09-02,B075KMT5HW,282
283,"It works, the nightmare is mostly over.","It really does work, and this is the next best thing to removing the smart meter entirely. Unfortunately there is no opt-out program here in Pennsylvania, so switching out the meter for an analog one is illegal. I felt the difference immediately after installing this meter cover. It comes with 2 pieces of foam as well as an adjustable nut and bolt to make sure that it fits snugly. If you are handy with making things, you could probably buy the materials to make your own for a third of this price. That's really the only complaint that I have though. Thank you!",5,1,4,2019-09-19,B075KMT5HW,283
284,"Easy Install, Responsive and Knowledgeable Seller","Exactly what I was looking for. Cover arrived quickly and installation was easy--simply slide it on the meter. Detailed instructions, and extra padding included for a more snug fit if needed. Seller very responsive to questions and very knowledgeable. My Cornet 88 measured immediate, clearly noticeable drops in electric field and RF spike power. Mag fields lower as well. Price is great.",5,1,8,2018-08-24,B075KMT5HW,284
285,It fit my smart meter perfectly with the included insert,"I had no trouble installing this. It came with 2 different thicknesses of foam to tighten up the fit if it's too big. Made it fit perfectly. I put a piece of foil inside that gap that is for lines or something coming out of the smart meter. My meter is flat to the box it's on, so I filled the gap. Does it work? I hope so, but I don't have a meter of my own to test it. I took the pictures online from reviewers as true. My smart meter was directly outside the wall of my bedroom next to a window. The power company wanted $38 to come out and exchange it for an analog meter and I would have had to pay $26 monthly for the privilege of having no EMF next to my bedroom 5 feet from me.",5,1,1,2020-09-05,B075KMT5HW,285
286,A must have!,Duke gave our neighborhood no choice but to accept Smart meters or decline and pay additional $98 per month on our already high electric bill. I immediately ordered this but in the time waiting for arrival sleep disturbance and heart palpitations. Within 2 days of installing shield I'm back to normal. Trying to convince neighbor but she doesn't believe.,5,1,4,2020-05-16,B075KMT5HW,286
287,It Is Exactly What We Expected,"What can I say about this smart meter cover? Well...it isn't too flimsy. It should last a few years. The item looks and covers the meter exactly as it was described. It was easy to put over the meter. It fits securely. I have no idea if it works or not, because I don't have a meter to measure the frequency output. Nevertheless, I bought the item knowing that, so I can hardly lay fault on the seller.",5,1,3,2018-12-13,B075KMT5HW,287
288,"Good quality, great price - fits perfectly","Fit well with included foam strip, fast shipping, we definately notice a better sleep. Would buy again.",5,1,6,2018-10-13,B075KMT5HW,288
289,My electric company couldn't read the meter,"They said to remove it because they couldn't get a meter reading.
Additionally, they said it's a hoax and to save my money.",2,1,6,2019-04-03,B075KMT5HW,289
290,"Helped with arthritis, digestive issues, and blood pressure","I put this on my smartmeter the day I received it, and I noticed one significant difference the next day. For the past 7-8 years, everyday in the morning when I get out of bed my feet hurt so bad. I limp around until they ""warm up."" The next day after installation my feet didn't hurt in the morning and haven't hurt since. I wake up and can walk just fine! I've also noticed a difference in my digestion and blood pressure (which randomly started getting sky high for no reason starting last year). Quite literally, the day or so after installing these things. However, I have noticed these severe headaches. I'm not sure it's if it's a sign of detox, but I have put the meter guard on, a cage over my wifi, gaurds for my computer and cell phone. I have done this all at once, and I'm having headaches like I've never had before. Has anyone else noticed this?",5,1,1,2020-10-18,B075KMT5HW,290
291,A good fit,The smart meter that I ordered fit perfectly over my meter. I only wish I could find a Farraday Cage for Spectrum's 5G Broadband that they're advertising is on the way!,5,1,5,2019-04-05,B075KMT5HW,291
292,Does what it says it should.,Works very well. Measured before and after the installation. Finally something that can be done after having a smart meter forcefully installed on the INSIDE of my home. #politricks,4,1,6,2019-03-15,B075KMT5HW,292
293,AMAZING SLEEP,It's been six weeks since I installed the smart meter cover. We have slept so much better as our smart meter faces into our bedroom. We have received our electric bill as normal. So pleased!,5,1,7,2019-05-22,B075KMT5HW,293
294,"Well Made, Came Quickly","The cover was constructed with quality materials and designed well. Although it wasn't an exact fit, the smart meter was covered completely. The difference in size was very slight because of this metal band that is around the meter, so the cover doesn't sit perfectly. I tried to see if the cover could bend around the band. Nope. Although part of the cover sits unevenly, all of the meter is covered and stays put, so it doesn't seem to be a problem.",5,1,3,2018-08-11,B075KMT5HW,294
295,All the good reviews are true!,"I have two smart meters. The cover fit the well house meter perfectly. The shop meter was quite a bit smaller, so I used the padded foam rings as directed on the second meter cover and it fit good and snug. The directions are written in concise english and the print is large and clear. I'm impressed with this well made product. Excellent company to do business with.",5,1,1,2020-02-27,B075KMT5HW,295
296,Doesn't fit.,I cannot get this flush even with the strips the included,2,1,5,2019-03-05,B075KMT5HW,296
297,Fits well,"Honestly, I am not sure whether it works or not. I can't tell any difference after installation, and I don't have a measuring device available. It's constructed well and fits well. We are in Texas using Coserv meters. This device fits our meter from Coserv.",3,1,2,2019-01-01,B075KMT5HW,297
298,Good night's sleep,"Since smart meters were installed in my neighborhood, 2 of my dogs died suddenly. My neighbor<U+0092>s dog also died unexpectedly.

After easily installing this smart meter cover, I have been sleeping through the night.",5,1,3,2019-10-17,B075KMT5HW,298
299,"Good Quality, but can't tell any difference","This is of good quality but I still hear a large roar or din in my ears. I thought it was from the smart meter but it's something else, so I cannot tell much difference in the radiation.",4,1,2,2019-08-25,B075KMT5HW,299
300,It does what they say.,"I measured the rf field before installation and it was 120. After install the reading was 26 which was nearly a 5X reduction in signal strength. Went on easily and you tighten the metal band with one screw. I did not need to use any of the foam as the diameter of my meter was nearly the same as the ring on the cover. If you have a concern, this really works. I made the measurements with a professional rf meter.",5,1,2,2019-10-10,B075KMT5HW,300
301,It's on!,"Took a while to arrive. Came a little dinged up, but doesn't seem to effect the function. Was way too big and only fit with the larger foam strip. I just hope the city leaves it on there. Not sure yet if it helps block emissions because I don't have a meter yet. Overall, I'm fine with this purchase.",4,1,4,2019-01-26,B075KMT5HW,301
302,Emf radiation,Well made a bit over priced but it does the emf blocking needed to mitigate its harmful radiation. Does not block dirty sine wave electricity that smart (dumb) meters produce in the inside of your home. I recommend that one test their meter to see where their readings.,4,1,2,2019-01-11,B075KMT5HW,302
303,Didn't work,There was no difference in my readings having this on our meter,1,1,6,2019-05-25,B075KMT5HW,303
304,Overpriced and didn't work (for me),"Couple of things, it doesn't work and way overpriced. Used my EMP meter before and after, readings were about the same. Material used for the product doesn't justify the price.",1,1,4,2019-09-05,B075KMT5HW,304

306,LA DWP lock addition makes the product too small,"Product was exactly as described. Included fittings for smaller meters. Unfortunately, Los Angeles DWP welded on a separate lock ring. That made the shield too small to fully snap in place. I have wedged it on as best as possible. So far it has stayed in place. The EMF meter shows a much lower reading. Thanks!",5,1,2,2019-04-23,B075KMT5HW,306

308,This Meter Cover Works! Everyone needs this!,"We were concerned about all the Radiation being emitted from our ""smart meter"" on our house. We used a meter to measure the amount of radiation before and after plcing the cover on the meter and the difference was amazing! This smart meter cover really does keep radiation from being emitted plus it allows the power company to still be able to read the meter...no interruption. Thankful for this product to protect our health!",5,1,0,2020-02-26,B075KMT5HW,308
309,Smart purchase,"So far everything is great! Arrived super quick and install was easy. I am shopping around for a RF meter, so I can test my house and check this cover, but the physics behind it makes complete sense.",5,1,2,2019-07-17,B075KMT5HW,309

311,Taking care of ourselves.,"Though I have a gated and locked acre of land with No Trespassing signs, Diverse Power in Georgia jumped the fence while I was out of town. They installed the Smart Meter without my authority. Trying to get it removed is like trying to part the Red Sea. The next step was to take care of myself and my animals the best I could, so I ordered this Cover. It was easy to install and the EMF meter proved that I had combated most of the harmful radiation the damn thing puts out!",5,1,2,2019-12-25,B075KMT5HW,311
312,It really works.,My Geiger counter went crazy <U+0085>.and then I put this on the smart meter and the counter registered a safe level.,5,1,1,2019-08-21,B075KMT5HW,312
313,Smart Meter Cover RF Radiation Shield,"Fit perfectly around my meter. Did not interfere with the signal to the electric company. Don't know if that means it's not working properly, or if it is actually keeping signal from inside the house. Wish I had a meter to test it.",5,1,0,2019-12-08,B075KMT5HW,313
314,Great people to work with,"Ordered the product, received the product in a timely manner and installed it on my mothers meter and it worked great. Best price and good quality. Would and will be recommending this product to friends.",5,1,2,2019-04-07,B075KMT5HW,314

I took readings before and after installing the screen and there was absolutely NO difference in the reading. This is an excellent scam. The unit is very well built and easy to install but totally ineffective! Not many people own a Field Meter and this is why this company can get away with this.

It was super easy to put on, all you have to do is tighten the nut on the screw. I dont have an EMF meter to check if it's working or not. But there really isn't anything else to do to protect myself from the smart meter and removing it isn't an option. So thank you for making this product!",5,0,4,2019-01-29,B075KMT5HW,353
354,Smart Meter guard/cover Worthless?,"I put the Smart Meter cover on exactly as outlined in the instructions. I have had this in place for over 8 months. I had high hopes for this to help with how I'm feeling relating to EMF effects. I still have effects from EMF in my home. I don't use a television, only occasionally a microwave and I stand far away when in use.

I don't use many other electronics. I can't say that I see any benefit from purchasing an expensive shield and putting it in place. Looks like this was money down the drain. Buy at your own risk. I'm giving a two star rather than a one star rating as it looks like it was decent construction of the shield at this point. Been using less than a year.",2,0,1,2019-11-21,B075KMT5HW,354

I had to modify them to a certain extent because of the GAP that they put on them so they would fit the smart meters! Im still attacked electronically but these two EMF Covers I purchased Have made a significant block on the capabilities of the mind manipulations via the smart meters! I am able to get some sleep once again. before I installed these on my meters or I mean their meters I was suffering insomnia Relationship issues,erectile dysfunction, and Lucid Nightmares! So I recommend these smart covers they seriously work! CIAO! My two month review! Seriously buy these! But I live in a rural area, Im not so sure how they would suffice in a heavily populated urban area where there are so many many other smart meters! But in my case as I reside in this rural area far away from other smart meters they have proved effective! In an apartment complex im not so sure how effective they would be! You might have to purchase covers for the entire apartment complex or perhaps the entire neighborhood or perhaps the entire town! But seriously these should be supplied by the utility companies since these are their components! They ought to be mandatory with each and every SMART METER installation in the United States of America! CIAO!",5,0,0,2019-06-08,B075KMT5HW,355

358,This smart meter cover has made a difference in our health.,"It was easy to install. Both my husband and I are feeling better - the smart meter was about 6 - 8 feet were I work in the kitchen. I started having thyroid problems - hyperthyroid. With covering the smart meter and a slight diet change, plus some herbs, my thyroid is now good. Just had my check up. We go a step further now and shut off the main breaker to the house, when we sleep. We are sleeping much better. We are grateful for this product.",5,1,4,2019-10-17,B075KMT5HW,358
359,Does what it's designed to do,"As proven with my EMF frequency detector, this product does it's job by markedly reducing the excessive amount of microwave radiation utilized in ""smart"" meters.

370,Simple but worth it.,When I first got this I was a bit nervous about going to place it on my meter. For some reason I expected it to be far more complicated and dangerous and it was neither. It was very simple to install and protecting us from harmful radiation is well worth it.,4,1,0,2020-11-18,B08KTNVHNJ,370
371,High Quality and Blocks Radiation,"During these uncertain times, I am happy to see items like these that will help protect me from the effects of radiation entering my home.

372,Works As Described.. Blocks Radiation From Wifi,"If you are like us, the concern over EMF radiation exposure from all of our devices is growing, especially with the roll out of 5G. After testing my wifi router and finding it to be the largest cause of EMF in our house, we looked into purchasing a wifi cover. We took a chance on this cover because of the affordable price and are glad we did. It's large enough that both the router and modem fit inside with room to spare. The fabric itself is very durable. The most important question though... does it do its job? Yes, it blocks the EMF radiation, down to a much safer level. Does our wifi still work? Yes it does! I did notice the signal seems slightly weaker however we have no problems using our Firesticks, running multiple computers and cell phones or playing games etc. online so far. I have attached before and after photos so you can see proof of the EMF reading before adding the cover and after adding the cover. If it helps anyone, we have Spectrum wifi.",5,1,12,2020-10-20,B088B6KGH3,372
373,Hope it blocks the 5g cable modem radiation,"The metalic cover looks very much like the one in the picture. It would help if it had a slot for cables on the back. It's obvious every modem has cables that connect to the back of the unit. So I had to make a cut with a blade myself. Also, it should have some kind of closing, in order for the protection to be complete. I used paper clips to keep the opening closed. Other than that, I just hope it really blocks the 5g radiation.",3,1,5,2020-06-04,B088B6KGH3,373

382,Economical and effective,"It actually works!
Before using the bag my router and modem were putting out measurements close to 100 (safe reading is 5). Both router and modem fit in the large EMF bag and have proper ventilation. To minimize radiation leaking, I sealed it with a rubber band. Signal strength is still strong within the room but has been weakened beyond that. EMF reading with meter is not zeroed out but it remains within the ""safe"" zone.",4,1,16,2020-07-25,B089SPY166,382
383,I am confident it is blocking RF waves,I am confident the cover is blocking RF waves but have not given it a meter test since installation. My friend brought a meter over and the reading was off the chart in our living room. I would like to update this post once I do another reading. I did have to modify the cover to fit my WIFI router by undoing the stitching on the long side half way down and open up the short side to slip it over.,5,1,16,2020-06-27,B089SPY166,383

I have no way to tell how well it works, but I am hoping it blocks some of the emf's",4,1,0,2020-07-20,B089SPY166,390
391,5g protection,I love knowing my family is protected from my 5G router. It works because my Wi-Fi signal isn't as strong as it used to be. Do they make this big enough to wrap around a whole house lol,5,1,0,2020-06-23,B089SPY166,391
392,Zero Science,"WiFi works by sending out electromagnetic radio waves. So do FM and AM radio stations. WiFi actually emits less powerful signals than an FM radio station. So this bag will degrade your WiFi signal or do nothing at all. End of sentence. It is advertised as blocking the very waves used to transmit data through the air. If you want to lower the power used by your home router, you can configure the transmit power or Tx power of your radio.
EMF is a measurement of the frequency of the electromagnetic radio waves. Colors are literally electromagnetic radio waves in light bouncing off of objects. If you want to block all bands of EMF you would have to crawl into a black plastic sack and seal it air tight. And that would kill you.",5,1,0,2020-09-03,B089SPY166,392
393,Good emf cover.,"I was experiencing painful headaches and just an overall tension in my room completely unexplained. I researched the smart meter outside my room and came across this. I thought EMF radiation from the router will cause headache and migraines. SO My husband bought this WiFi router cover for me, and it worked well. My headace gone, and the tension in the roon gone. I sleep well after using this and it won<U+0092>t block the wifi singal, that<U+0092>s very nice.",1,0,2,2020-06-01,B089SPY166,393

423,That it fits,The metal could have been thick,5,1,0,2020-09-01,B0856XFX2L,423
424,This can't work,The Faraday Cage works only by COMPLETELY enclosing the transmitter or receiver with a capsule which must conduct current in all directions across the surface at all points with no openings measuring more than 1/2 the wavelength. Smart meters transmit waves as short as 4mm. Putting this cup over the front can't possibly attenuate the EMF at all as the opening is several centimeters.,1,0,4,2020-07-11,B0856XFX2L,424
425,Cheap but doesn't shield well,"I have an EMF detector and tested for levels of radiation in this canopy as well as the more expensive Naturell shielding canopy. In the same setup with a shielding pad underneath to create a full Faraday cage, the levels in the Naturell canopy were almost zero. While in this canopy they were reduced, roughly about half of what they were outside the canopy. I suppose that's what I get when I paid about half compared to the Naturell product! But very disappointed given $600 is still a lot of money.",2,1,2,2019-04-03,B075DDXL3X,425

429,Love the how easy it was to install.,"This product is just what we were looking for. Lightweight, sheer and elegant. Not bad for a hack to reduce RF radiation in your bedroom. The canopy comes in with a card that invites you to communicate with them in China if you have any questions. The people there were so helpful and very easy to work with. My customer service James responded with answers in a very timely manner and we were completely satisfied with our RF Canopy Shield. Can't say more how much we appreciate this quality product.

432,"It works, but you need to use is correctly","I can confirm this product works to shield EMFs and it is easy to set up. For my case, I hung it from a hook attached to the ceiling fan over my bed. HOWEVER, my experience is that you need to use it correctly for the shielding to work correctly. You need to hang it from the ceiling so it is acting as a completely enclosed canopy hanging over (but not touching) you. When I used it that way my EMF meter read zero. If the canopy is sagging or laying on top of you like a blanket the EMF shielding will be poor.",5,1,10,2019-11-14,B075DDXL3X,432

434,takes cell tower signal down 2 notches,"will block all 2g signals around you, but you need to double it up (buy 2) to take 5g wireless down to two bars. no matter what, this will make you sleep MUCH better!!! and, ps. don't sleep with your cell phone inside of it!!!",5,1,5,2019-05-26,B075DDXL3X,434
435,It works!,"I bought this canopy 2 weeks ago and am happy with the purchase. It does not smell. looks good and blocks 20 out of 25 Wi-fi networks. However, it's not very effective against cell-phone signal - my phone goes from 3 bars to 2 bars inside this canopy. And it's not protecting from my neighbors hearing device that she plugs in her TV (I think it's Bluetooth based). BUT, it costs almost half the price of the most expensive ones, so the price is justified if you travel or are on a budget.",5,1,0,2019-05-12,B075DDXL3X,435
436,RF leaks in,"RF leaks in, a lot, as indicated on my RF meter. Partial block is harmful since the mechanism of RF shielding is REFLECTION. So if RF leaks inside the canopy, it bounces off the fabric in multiple directions multiple times, bombarding your body all night long. A reputable US based EMF product company (20+ yrs) rep said that the RF leaking inside does get reflected multiple times. My mistake of trying to save $ by getting this... RF shielding material needs to be high quality with PROPER set up to be of any benefit. The shielding does not make RF magically disappear, but it DEFLECTS it. So it matters where you are located with respect to the fabric and RF source. You want to be located on the opposite side of the RF source with the fabric between you and the RF. Otherwise (RF source closer to you than the fabric), you are being hit with radiation at least the twice the amount than not having it at all.",1,0,1,2020-07-22,B075DDXL3X,436
437,Works as mentioned on the detail page,Read the non tin foil guide and found this product. This goes some way in reducing the emf from the wifi. Have noticed some reduction in speed since the antenna in this arrangement can be only in one orientation (due to the geometry of the sleeve) ...but it is a trade-off worth while for the price,5,1,4,2020-01-10,B07ZFCKDDS,437
438,"Cover works, but will adversely affect your download speed","I bought this EMF cover with skepticism. While I have not used a detector to look at EMF level changes, it initially appears to work. When uncovered, my router performed with a 66.8 MB download speed. When covered, my router performed with a 8 MB download speed. Upload speed changes were negligible. It was able to fit over a Verizon router from front while leaving back clear for cables

This would be good for those who want to cover at night during sleep or when away from home. It would not be good to cover and leave unless you want to reduce wireless speed capability",4,1,1,2020-08-17,B07ZFCKDDS,438

I feel a lot safer for my family and me. I will recommend using one for work too.",5,1,2,2020-01-27,B07ZFCKDDS,442
443,Works,Product worked well but did not fit my router. Did block up to more than half of the RF<U+0092>s out,5,1,2,2020-03-12,B07ZFCKDDS,443
444,DOES NOT WORK,Waster of money the WiFi box still gives out radiation $50.00 for nothing. The radiation meter didn<U+0092>t even drop a few points with the case.,1,1,2,2020-04-11,B07ZFCKDDS,444
445,Works!,"Good product, seems to work.",4,1,1,2020-03-09,B07ZFCKDDS,445
446,Easy to use,"Seems flimsy. Easy to put on. Not sure how much it works, hard to tell.",4,1,2,2020-03-12,B07ZFCKDDS,446
